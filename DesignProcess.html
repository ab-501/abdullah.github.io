    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>
        This project was started prematurely by researching technologies and software to use such as database managers and frameworks.
        However, due to the large amount of possible technology to use, I decided to scale back and start with just an initial design, as shown below:
        <br><br><br>
        First, I drew the initial layout of each page and what content would be contained within each. I considered separating this project into a professional and personal website but was unhappy with the lack of content doing so would produce.
        <br>
        Next, I started by using what I knew and creating this project from the base technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP with phpMyAdmin as the Database connection.
        <br>
        Now, happy with a suitable and functioning website, I deployed it to GtHub Pages for easy access.
        <br>
        Finally, I would upgrade the site by using a framework.
